Libraries that are necessary for the program to work:
numpy, scipy, openpyxl.

Run the main.py file.

The program will ask you: "Data or plot? "

If you input "data" at the start of the program, 
the program will create a Excel table (make sure to change the file_path at the constants.py file)
with some necessary data for all the cases. Currently most the values that could be calculated
are commented out, but that could be changed. Be mind reading comments, not all values/functions
are working correctly.

If you input "plot" at the start of the program, the program will ask you: "Velocity or pressure? ".

If you input "vel", the program will create and automatically save figures of V(lambda_c) and velocity slopes
for a specific value of gamma, k_rho and all the possible values of n_int.

If you input "pres", the program will create and automatically save scaled figures of P(lambda_c) for all the cases.

If there will be any updates, I will write them here.
