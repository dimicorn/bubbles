Run the main.py file.

If you input "data" at the start of the program, 
the program will create a Excel table (make sure to change the file_path at the constants.py file)
with all the data from Appendix B1 and the values of R_sw in astronomical units from Appendix B2.

If you input "plot" at the start of the program,
the program will create multiple plots for different values of n_int.

If there will be any updates, I will write them here.
